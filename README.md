### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former physics instructor who is looking to transition to data science and data analytics. Iâ€™m currently learning Python for data science with Codecademy. I'm almost done with the Data Science path!

Iâ€™m currently working on lots of things! Right now my main projects are Codecademy Pro capstone projects as I work toward my completion of their Data Science path. But I am also working on a toy supervised machine learning project, and a couple of Kaggle datasets as well. Feel free to look through my repositories to see what all I have done!

Check out my starred repositories below; those are my highlighted projects.
