### Hi there 👋

I am a former physics instructor who has transitioned to data science. I completed Codecademy's Data Scientist and Data Analyst Career paths in 2021 and have been building upon what I learned there, both professionally and personally.

My main language is Python, although I spent about a decade using IDL coding for my research. I'm familiar with Pandas, Matplotlib, plot.ly, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, and Streamlit. I have worked a little bit with TensorFlow, Keras, Statsmodels, Optuna, and LangChain. I am also familiar with SQL, largely with PostgreSQL although I have have exposure to MS SQL Server and TeraData, and the basics of maintaining a GitHub repository. 

I'm working on lots of things at the moment! I'm currently reading through the book Natural Language Processing In Action by Lane, Howard, and Hapke, and I'll upload work based on that when it makes sense to do so. I've been exploring RAG a bit with Google Colab and will link to that when it makes sense to do so. I'm also polishing up a small little project dealing with machine learning for predictive maintenance. Stay tuned for updates! And feel free to look through my repositories to see what all I have done.

I should also mention that I've started my Tableau learning journey! Follow along here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michelle.caler/vizzes
