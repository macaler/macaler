### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former physics instructor who is looking to transition to data science and data analytics. Iâ€™m currently learning Python for data science with Codecademy. I recently completed Codecademy's Data Science and Data Analysis Career Paths and I am eager to put what I learned into practice!

I'm working on lots of things at the moment! My main project is a Codecademy Pro natural language processing portfolio project. But I am also working on a couple of Kaggle datasets as well. Feel free to look through my repositories to see what all I have done!

Check out my starred repositories below; those are my highlighted projects.
